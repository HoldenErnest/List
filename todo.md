## ToDo
- Backups of some kind (automatic if the changes are more than a few bytes?)
- add option to remove lists (include an are you sure by making user input their password)
- allow access offline (configure an "I want to use this offline" button)
- login page button
- settings page (see project-styling.drawio)
- link icon next to shared lists. maybe also initials of owner?


## Features
- induvidual list settings
- Add an add list button/ "display" button
- multiple lists
- list folders
- better tags setup (toggle list of tags)
- button for manual backup (in settings lmao get destroyed)


## Design
- Change the icon to be something better and or cooler
- maybe a name change to be something better
- setting? Auto fill in date when typing in six numbers next to each other, ex: 020724 ("too much work im dying" -Holden)


## Bugs
- if you change title, empty the buffer for image urls (right now they stay on the last images searched)
- (testing) app crashed when there was a conflict save (idk how to replicate)

## Potential Settings
- things listed in other catagories(too lazy to look through rn)
- UI scaler, how big do you want each list item
