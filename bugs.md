## Features
- settings
- multiple lists
- So just like discord have a folder of lists compiled together and when you click it it expands out just like discord and shows all the lists in the folder
- better tags setup


## Design
- Change the icon to be something better and or cooler
- maybe a name change to be something better


## Bugs
- fix the backspace bug when searching
- if you remove list while still in the "add" feature you can not add another one to replace it
- setting? Auto fill in date when typing in two numbers ex: 020724
