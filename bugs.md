## Design
- Change the icon to be something better and or cooler ✓
- maybe a name change to be something better ✓
- setting? Auto fill in date when typing in six numbers next to each other, ex: 020724 ("too much work im dying" -Holden)


## Bugs
- if you change title, empty the buffer for image urls (right now they stay on the last images searched) ✓
- Not sure if this is actually a bug but when dragging the list around on my desktop the - and fullscreen buttons flicker (scaling issue with wondows not  a bug) ✓

## Potential Settings
- things listed in other catagories(too lazy to look through rn)
- UI scaler, how big do you want each list item
